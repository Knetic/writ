I constantly find myself needing to write down some obscure steps to accomplish a goal. It usually only needs to happen once, and is forgotten. Usually, re-googling is enough to solve the problem. But sometimes the specific setup being used requires a hybrid of obvious answers, or a little extra knowledge not captured in regular posts.

The irony of sequestering this knowledge away in easy-to-access documents, instead of just writing a blog, is not lost on me. It's probably worth creating a `blog.glester.com` or something like that, then finding an easy way to just format these and send them off.
