					I constantly find myself needing to write down some obscure steps to accomplish a goal. 
					Whatever I'm after usually only needs to be done once, and is forgotten by the time I need it again (or when i mention it to someone else who is interested). 
					Usually, re-googling is enough to solve the problem. But sometimes the specific setup being used requires a hybrid of obvious answers, or a little extra knowledge not captured in regular posts.

					<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526/stack-overflow-is-doing-me-ongoing-harm-its-time-to-fix-it">ethical</a>, and 
					<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333678/was-the-retroactive-change-to-cc-by-sa-4-0-approved-by-stack-exchanges-lawyers">legal</a> 
					concerns about how that site is operated by its new management.
					Given all that, it's more responsible to publish the information myself, direct people towards specific articles, and for everyone else - hope that search engines index it properly.
