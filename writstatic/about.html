					I constantly find myself needing to write down some obscure steps to accomplish a goal. 
					Whatever I'm after usually only needs to be done once, and is forgotten by the time I need it again (or when i mention it to someone else who is interested). 
					Usually, re-googling is enough to solve the problem. But sometimes the specific setup being used requires a hybrid of obvious answers, or a little extra knowledge not captured in regular posts.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So, this whole thing exists to put that information on the internet, to fill in the blanks where the previous published knowledge isn't quite there.

					In the past, I'dve advised asking an informational question on the appropriate StackExchange site. However, I'm one of those insufferable people who has 
					<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314302/are-we-creating-divisions-in-our-quest-to-make-new-users-welcome">cultural</a>, 
					<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526/stack-overflow-is-doing-me-ongoing-harm-its-time-to-fix-it">ethical</a>, and 
					<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333678/was-the-retroactive-change-to-cc-by-sa-4-0-approved-by-stack-exchanges-lawyers">legal</a> 
					concerns about how that site is operated by its new management, increasingly corporate and money-focused actions, and hostility towards the 
					<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stack-overflow-none-of-us-is-as-dumb-as-all-of-us/">original goal</a> of the site.
				</p>

				<p>
					Given the lack of places where this kind of technical knowledge can be entrusted; 
					it's more responsible to publish the information myself, direct people towards specific articles,
					and for everyone else - hope that search engines index it properly. 
					Which is how the whole Internet was always supposed to work.
