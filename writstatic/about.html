					I constantly find myself needing to write down some obscure steps to accomplish a technical goal. 
					Whatever I'm after usually only needs to be done once, and is forgotten by the time I need it again (or when i mention it to someone else who is interested). 
					Usually, re-googling is enough to solve the problem. But sometimes the specific setup being used requires a hybrid of obvious answers, or a little extra knowledge not captured in regular posts.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So, this whole thing exists to put that information on the internet, 
					to fill in the blanks where the previous published knowledge isn't quite there.
				</p>

					In the past, I'dve advised asking an informational question on the appropriate StackExchange site. However, I'm one of those insufferable people who has 
					<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314302/are-we-creating-divisions-in-our-quest-to-make-new-users-welcome">cultural</a>, 
					<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526/stack-overflow-is-doing-me-ongoing-harm-its-time-to-fix-it">ethical</a>, and 
					<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333678/was-the-retroactive-change-to-cc-by-sa-4-0-approved-by-stack-exchanges-lawyers">legal</a> 
					concerns about how that site is operated by its new management, their increasingly corporate and money-focused actions, and the ownership's hostility towards the 
					<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/stack-overflow-none-of-us-is-as-dumb-as-all-of-us/">original goal</a> of the site.
				</p>

				<p>
					Given the lack of places where this kind of technical knowledge can be entrusted; 
					it's more responsible to publish the information myself, direct people towards specific posts,
					and for everyone else - hope that search engines index it properly. 
					Which is how the whole Internet was always supposed to work.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					On a technical level for this site itself, the static content is hosted on nginx, and i wrote some middleware that on-the-fly converts markdown-to-html 
					(using <a href="https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown">this</a>).
					The posts are on the same server, and the folder they live in are shared by 
					<a href="https://github.com/knetic/boji">webdav</a> - so that i can create/edit posts from anywhere without needing to run any after-the-fact processes, or fighting with a CMS.
				</p>

					If you're looking for a bio of me as a person, that's not what this is for.
